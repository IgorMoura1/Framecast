# Framecast
Landing page styled as a broadcast room with looping videos. Built using Three.js and dat.GUI, it features a 3D grid of video planes. Videos serve as textures with dynamically calculated positions, rotations, and parallax effects. A camera and WebGL renderer display the scene, while mouse movement triggers animations, adding interactivity.
